🌱 “Warm-Up” Mini-Projects (10–20 minutes each)

These help you practice basic components & props.

Greeting Card Component – A component that takes a name as a prop and displays “Hello, {name}!”

Simple Avatar Card – Show an image + name + short text.

Colorful Box – Render a div with a background color passed in as a prop.

⚡ State & Events Basics

These will help you click things and update UI—classic React fuel.

Counter App – Increase/decrease/reset. Everyone builds one, and it’s weirdly satisfying.

Toggle Light/Dark Box – A square that changes color when clicked.

Show/Hide Text – Button toggles a paragraph’s visibility.

⌨️ Handling Input

Great for understanding controlled components.

Live Text Previewer – Whatever you type in an input shows below in real time.

Character Counter – Input box + “You typed X characters.”

To-Do List Lite – Add items, display them. No deleting yet.

🎛 Arrays & Simple Rendering

Practice mapping data into components.

FAQ Accordion (Very Simple) – Click a question → show answer.

Emoji Reactions List – List of emojis stored in an array; clicking adds one to the page.

Mini Contact List – Show a few people with names + phone numbers.

📦 Beginner-Friendly “Mini-Apps”

Still simple, but feel like “real apps.”

Color Picker – Dropdown with colors → box updates color.

Random Quote Generator – Preload 5–10 quotes; button shows a random one.

Basic Calculator – Add/subtract/multiply/divide two inputs.
